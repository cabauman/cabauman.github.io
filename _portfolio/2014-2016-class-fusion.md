This is a project that came about when I moved to South Korea in 2013 to teach English. I'm always looking for ways to utilize my programming skillset, so this was a perfect opportunity. Class fusion integrates educational games into a student reward system, which serves as an incentive for good behavior.

- Add/remove classes and student profiles
- Coins earned in games are automatically added to student profiles
- Customizeable milestones/rewards
- Use earned coins in the virtual store
- Avatar selection
- 2 games: team & single player modes
- Game playable with xBox controller

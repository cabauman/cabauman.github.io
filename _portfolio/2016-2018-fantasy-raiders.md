Because of the small team, I had the luxury of being able to contribute heavily to almost every area of the frontend codebase. My main contributions were UI and gameplay, including context menu, main menu, notifications, skill system, equipment/weapon system, quest system, mailbox, etc. It started out as a mobile application, but it was ultimately decided to only release on Steam. And that's me doing the narration in the video.

Fantasy Raiders was the first professional game project that I was a part of. I joined the team at Maverick Games from February 2016 to July 2018. Because of the small team, I had the luxury of being able to contribute heavily to almost every area of the frontend codebase. My main contributions were UI and core gameplay systems including

- context menu
- hp bar
- notification system
- main menu
  - mailbox screen
  - quest screen
  - inventory screen
  - equipment screen
  - map screen
  - skill tree screen
  - settings screen

It started out as a mobile application, but it was ultimately decided to only release on Steam. And that's me doing the narration in the video.

The hotel safety committee game, that I programmed for my former employer (07/2008 - 01/2013), turned out great. My boss at the time, who successfully ran this incentive program at other high end hotels, had always used a physical game board in the past. There are currently 4 editions: City, Halloween, Christmas, and Classic.

**Basic concept**

The player selects concealers one at a time to reveal hidden prizes. The player continues to make selections until either all 12 prizes or all 4 whammies are revealed. The goal is to avoid whammies. They are like strikes in baseball except you have 4 chances. The revealed whammies are displayed in the top right corner of the screen. The prizes can be set on the Prize Settings screen, accessible from the home screen.

**What is a concealer?**

A concealer is any object that "conceals" or hides a prize (or whammy) from the player. There are 16 identical concealers in each theme, labeled with a number, 1-16. Each theme contains a different concealer object. Classic uses wooden crates, Halloween uses tombstones, City uses street signs, and Christmas used gift boxes.

**How a player is selected**

Safety Survivor cards are handed out by the security department when an employee is seen doing something proactive for safety (e.g. mopping up a wet floor or removing clutter from a walkway). At the end of each month there is a drawing to determine who will play, as a reward for being conscious of safety.

[Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/)

> Oh My Posh is a custom prompt engine for any shell that has the ability to adjust the prompt string with a function or variable. A segment renders a single context like showing the current folder, user information or git status when relevant. It can be styled any way you want, resulting in visualizing the prompt you are looking for.

Because I frequently use Unity Engine and am a fan of the oh-my-posh terminal extension, I decided to contribute a custom *segment* that displays the Unity version and C# version of the current working directory. This was my first time using Go.

**Global Game Jam 2016**

This was a fun little project that I worked on for my second GGJ in South Korea. The theme was "Ritual". My team consisted of 2 programmers (including myself), 3 artists, 1 designer, and 1 sound designer. Oh, and that's me doing the narration in the video ðŸ˜„

<blockquote><p>
Become a god, pay attention to people's rituals, grant their wishes, and get more followers as many as possible. Some enthusiastic followers might insist on sending you goatsâ€¦which could be quite useful... @god#help is a fast-paced game simulating a god's demanding daily tasks. Make quick decisions not to disappoint the followers, and develop all the cities to the maximum levels to win.

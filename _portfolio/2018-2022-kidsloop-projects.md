I worked with many different technologies while developing these services such as Postgres, GraphQL, Redis, AWS (S3, Lambda, ECS, DynamoDB, RDS, IAM), Terraform, Postgres, and Docker. I was originally hired as a Unity Engineer, but when company priorities changed, they asked if I'd be interested in switching over to backend engineering. I'm always up for learning new things and expanding my software engineering skill set, so I accepted. My excitement for the opportunity also took over my personal/hobby development time, which was normally dedicated to Unity and C#. I had never really done any backend engineering or NodeJS/TypeScript development, so I went all-in on studying and practicing. I still prefer game development, but this was an enjoyable and enlightening experience.

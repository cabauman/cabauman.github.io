TT (TongTong) Korean School is a Korean study app that I developed for the Korean Academy where I was studying. It was published on the Google Play store from 2016 - 2018. I started doing a remake in .NET Maui but priorities changed, so it's on the backburner for now. The Korean teachers created illustrations and audio recordings for flashcards. The key features include

- Mini flashcards
- Detailed flashcards
- Course registration
- Match game
- Favorites (vocab)
- Google map
- Google, Facebook, and email login

The main Firebase services that were utilized are Database, Storage, and Authentication.

### Loss Prevention Database

Purpose: Tool for tracking incident reports and connecting them to employee records

Highlights:

- Utilized at Omni La Mansion Del Rio and Mokara Hotel and Spa

The LP Database was motivated by my discontent with the declining state of our previous system, as well as my excitement regarding the potential that new features could bring to the table.

### Lost and Found (L&F) Tracker

Software Utilized: Microsoft Excel/VBA

Purpose: Tool for logging L&F items, L&F inquiries by guests, and L&F shipments/pick-ups

Highlights:

- Utilized at Omni La Mansion Del Rio, Mokara Hotel and Spa, and Hyatt Hill Country Resort and Spa
- Associate "Top 30" statistic provides an incentive for Housekeepers to turn in L&F items.
- VBA forms allow for data submission into protected worksheets so entries can't be altered.
- Dynamic drop-down lists for user and associate names enforce uniformity and enable easy additions and deletions.
- Form verification ensures all required fields have been filled.

This tool is the result of combining three closely related systems into one document and adding some bonus features. It is much more efficient, prevents careless errors, and records statistics for analysis by the head of our department. Our previous process duplicated information, wasted time navigating folders to open various documents, and became messy/unorganized over time.

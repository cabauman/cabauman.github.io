## Oh My Posh

[ohmyposh.dev](https://ohmyposh.dev/){: .btn .btn--info}

**Tech:** Go

> Oh My Posh is a custom prompt engine for any shell that has the ability to adjust the prompt string with a function or variable. A segment renders a single context like showing the current folder, user information or git status when relevant. It can be styled any way you want, resulting in visualizing the prompt you are looking for.

Because I frequently use Unity Engine and am a fan of the oh-my-posh terminal extension, I decided to contribute a custom *segment* that displays the Unity version and C# version of the current working directory. This was my first time using Go.

## H5P-Nodejs-library

**Tech:** NodeJS, TypeScript

> This library provides everything needed to create custom H5P servers running on NodeJS. It is written in TypeScript and fully typed, which makes it much easier to work with than the official PHP server. Of course, it's also possible to use this library in projects with JavaScript (ES5) and you will still profit from the typings by getting code completion in your IDE.

## About this blog

Welcome to my code journal, where I share insights into my day-to-day development experiences, mostly related to C# and game dev with Unity. These experiences can range anywhere from bug resolution stories to feature implementations to performance optimizations, etc. Keeping a code journal is a great way to track growth and build a knowledge base, even if it's just in a private Google Doc. By making it available to the public, the hope is that other developers, like myself, find the information helpful and are able to utilize it.

## About me

My name is Colt Bauman. I have about 8 years of professional experience, and 14 years overall as a software engineer. 6 of those 8 years are C#/Unity based, and the other 2 years are NodeJS/backend based. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Game and Simulation Programming in February of 2012, where C++ and C# were the primary languages.

I'm a C# enthusiast, so I stay up to date with all the latest language features and .NET releases, and spend most of my free time working on C# libraries (both personal and open source) and game development with Unity. My passion for profiling and understanding low-level C# has allowed me to become proficient at writing highly optimized code. Writing source generators and Roslyn analyzers is another aspect that I enjoy.

Other areas that I'm passionate about include
- writing clean code that's easy to maintain and understand
- test writing
- inversion of control (IoC)
- linear algebra and geometric algebra

Most of my mobile application experience stems from Unity, but hobby-wise I've also worked on Xamarin projects and one native Android application using Java which was published to Google Play for a while. For Unity I've used Java, Kotlin, and Objective C for creating native Android and iOS plugins.

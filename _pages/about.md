## About this blog

Welcome to my code journal, where I share insights into my day-to-day development experiences, mostly related to game development. These experiences can range anywhere from bug resolution stories to feature implementations to performance optimizations, etc. Keeping a code journal is a great way to track growth and build a knowledge base, even if it's just in a private Google Doc. By making it available to the public, the hope is that other developers 1) feel inspired and 2) find the information helpful.

## About me

My name is Colt Bauman. I have about 9 years of professional experience, and 16 years overall as a software engineer. 7 of those 9 years are C#/Unity based, and the other 2 years are NodeJS/backend based. I also have 1 year of professional experience using Unreal Engine and C++. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Game and Simulation Programming in February of 2012, where C++ and C# were the primary languages.

In terms of game development, I'm most passionate about
- 3D vector math
- implementing game mechanics and systems
- low level techniques implemented by game engines

Other areas that I'm passionate about include
- performance optimization
- C# source generators and Roslyn analyzers
- unit and integration test writing
- inversion of control (IoC)

Most of my mobile application experience stems from Unity, but hobby-wise I've also worked on Xamarin projects and one native Android application using Java which was published to Google Play for a while. For Unity I've used Java, Kotlin, and Objective C for creating native Android and iOS plugins.

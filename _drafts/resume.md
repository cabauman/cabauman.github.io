## About this blog

Welcome to my code journal, where I share insights into my day-to-day development experiences, mostly related to game development. These experiences can range anywhere from bug resolution stories to feature implementations to performance optimizations, etc. Keeping a code journal is a great way to track growth and build a knowledge base, even if it's just in a private Google Doc. By making it available to the public, the hope is that other developers 1) feel inspired and 2) find the information helpful.

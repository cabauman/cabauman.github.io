You may already know about the script templates folder [in the installation directory](https://support.unity.com/hc/en-us/articles/210223733-How-to-customize-Unity-script-templates){:target="_blank"}, but did you also know that "ScriptTemplates" is a special folder name in a Unity project?

You can include custom templates per project.

Without templates, one of the first things I do for many new scripts is remove the default Start and Update methods, along with the comments. In the attached screenshots I use an interface template and a "classes sealed by default" template.

Use "swatch libraries" to store frequently used colors, gradients, and animation curves. For example, I recently used this feature for a project to store the color palette chosen by designers, which I in turn utilized in a ScriptableObject for access in code. Small convenience features like this are nothing new in Unity, but are easy to overlook.
